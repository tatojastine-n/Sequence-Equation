# Sequence-Equation
This C# program solves the "Permutation Equation" problem. The `permutationEquation` function maps each number in the permutation `p` to its position, then finds, for each `i` from 1 to `n`, the position of the position of `i` and stores it in the result list. The `Main` method reads the permutation from input, calls the function, and outputs the resulting sequence.
